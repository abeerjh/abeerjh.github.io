## Google Data Analytics Capstone:

Part of finishing the Google Data Analytics course is to choose and complete a capstone project. Upon completing the project, each student will be able to showcase their understanding of data analysis steps and technical skills that they have learned from the course. The project that I have chosen was the Cyclistic Cases Study.
